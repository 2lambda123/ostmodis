A quick, naive implementation of [@celoyd](https://github.com/celoyd)'s cloud-removal algorithm for satellite images. 

It was December of 2012 and I wanted some cloud-free satellite images. I thought 
"Hey, didn't Charlie [do something like this](https://www.flickr.com/photos/vruba/8017203149/in/set-72157631622037685)? 
I should try implementing his approach!"
I hacked up what I could from that photo caption, then showed it to Charlie and he was kind enough to share his code -- buff-cube.py, pxpack.py and qp.py are all straight from him and tremendous improvements on the code I wrote.

If you want to remove clouds from your own images, you almost certainly want to use Charlie's public release [wheather](https://github.com/celoyd/wheather) instead of this 
-- it's more complete, more efficient, and infinitely better documented.
