A quick, naive implementation of [@celoyd](https://github.com/celoyd)'s cloud-removal algorithm for satellite images. 

It was December of 2012 and I wanted some cloud-free satellite images. I thought 
"Hey, didn't Charlie [do something like this](https://www.flickr.com/photos/vruba/8017203149/in/set-72157631622037685)? 
I should try implementing his approach!"
I hacked up what I could from that photo caption, then showed it to Charlie and he was kind enough to share his code -- buff-cube.py and pxpack.py are both straight from him and my code wouldn't be worth much without them.

If you want to remove clouds from your own images, you almost certainly want to use Charlie's public release [wheather](https://github.com/celoyd/wheather) instead of this 
-- it's more complete, more efficient, and infinitely better documented.
